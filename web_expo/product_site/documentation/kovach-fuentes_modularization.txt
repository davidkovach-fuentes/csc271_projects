Modular Functino: updateContent

Throughout my script, I noticed that I frequently use .innerHTML to change the innerHTML content of an element. It would make sense to have one function
to control everything and to specify the element and the new content as the parameters.

It make sense to convert these into a function to make the code more concise and also more readable.

updateContent(target, html) where target is the target element from the DOM and html is the updated innerHTML string
updateHome() a void function that just updates the homepage everytime it is loaded in the script
