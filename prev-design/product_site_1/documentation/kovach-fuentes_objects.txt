What the object represents on your product site.

  The object I will represent will be the navigator link as its own object.
  Using different nav-links will make it more readable when implementing nav-buttons.js

The data you need to store about this type of object (its properties).

  I will store the title and the link url
  I will also store a boolean to indicate if the link is active

The tasks or behaviors the object should be able to perform (its methods).

  I will include a method pulsate() to handle pulsating for the link
  I will also include the changeColor() method as well for its respective function
