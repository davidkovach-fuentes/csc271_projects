<!-- Assignment 5: Style Your Site
 Synopsis: This a simple HTML webpage that is based off of my wireframe design.
 My wireframe is meant to be a personal portfolio website that contains my professional information and projects.
 Although there is not a significant amount of content, I want to focus on creating this webpage as best as I can.

        I will update this webpage when I have more experience with CSS3_logo_and_wordmark <br>
        It feels like a grid or other container would be suitable to create the gallery of images <br>
        I want to transform the images on screen and turn them into a gallery format and place it on the
        right side of the screen
