<!-- Assignment 3: Your First Webpage
 Synopsis: This a simple HTML webpage that is based off of my wireframe design.
 My wireframe is meant to be a personal portfolio website that contains my professional information and projects.
 Although there is not a significant amount of content, I want to focus on creating this webpage as best as I can.

        This is designed to be a personal webpage to showcase my skills and projects.
        <br> I want this website to be modern and unique, yet professioal.
        <br> <em> I am hoping to implement different animations as part of my website.</em>
        <br> <strong> I also want this website to be lightweight and optimized for mobile.</strong>
        <br> <u>CSS is needed to style the elements on this page. </u>
